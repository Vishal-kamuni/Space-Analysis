# 🚀 Space Missions Data Analysis (1957–2020)

## 📊 Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a dataset containing details of over 4,000 space missions launched globally between 1957 and 2020. The analysis focuses on understanding trends in launch frequency, mission outcomes, company performance, and launch site usage.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Analyze trends in space launches over time  
- Identify the most active and reliable space organizations  
- Examine mission success rates and their evolution  
- Explore frequently used launch sites  
- Derive insights using visual storytelling

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization  
- **Google Colab Notebook** for analysis and reporting

## 📌 Key Insights

- Mission success rates have significantly improved since the 1960s.
- RVSN USSR has conducted the most launches historically, while ULA has the highest success rate.
- Baikonur Cosmodrome (Kazakhstan) is the most frequently used launch site.
- The number of launches peaked in the late 2010s, with over 100 launches per year.
